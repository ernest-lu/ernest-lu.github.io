      <description>Honestly, it takes me a while to try to understand my blog posts again. I have to trace the steps I took to get to same understanding on the problems I had in the moment.&#xA;I think really wanted to go deep into one specific niche topic, but without repeated application and excercise of such a topic, I was not as engaged in the material.&#xA;I personally attribute a lot of &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo;* and &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; in my life to an obsession with going deeper in a topic, where I want to really understand something.</description>

For example, the following problem has a pool of $n$ people, where exactly $k$ people must be designated as artists, and $j$ people must be designated as programmers.</description>
