Honestly, it takes me a while to try to understand my blog posts again. I have to trace the steps I took to get to same understanding on the problems I had in the moment.

I think really wanted to go deep into one specific niche topic, but without repeated application and excercise of such a topic, I was not as engaged in the material. 

I personally attribute a lot of "success"* and "results" in my life to an obsession with going deeper in a topic, where I want to really understand something. 

But going deeper doesn't necessarily mean trying something niche. In a sense, that's that is more of a "breadth" move, since I am learning something new. 

I think going deeper in a topic means developing your current understanding, applying what you know to solve something that you don't. I feel a lot of math is structured this way, in that, you don't need to know a lot of things apart from the fundamentals to understand something.

I think a lot of reason in trying to learn something new comes from a desire to gain more understanding, and to be more secure in what I know, but if results are what I'm after, then I should be more focused on this depth angle: using what I know to solve something I don't initially know how to do.

I feel like this is the whole essence of developing intuition for something. Using things already present in your brain, and formally defining what you already know how to do.

So, in the future, I hope to gain a better understanding of things and try to really understand something, and be more secure in what I know. Towards this goal, I'd like to try to simplify my problems as much as I can, which involves using simpler language and simpler concepts.

* Maybe another post on what success means
