I've read that when you think about the future, you are being anxious. I think that a lot of my thoughts have some relation to the future, with a common chain of thoughts being: "I don't know this -> I feel inadequate -> anxiety". When this feeling has actions that I can directly take, it generally has had a helpful, motivational impact on my life. For example, I feel some inadequacy in my fitness -> I go to the gym. However, when I don't have direct actions that I can come up with, this often spirals into a cycle of anxiety and browsing information in an attempt to address how I feel. An example might be feeling some inadequacy about career success -> browsing different linkedin profiles. 

It's pretty difficult to develop self-awareness about anxiety or how you feel in this state, but if I take a step back, my anxiety added unecessary stress to my life. From my experience, this feeling will inevitably pass and return in waves regardless of what I do. The thoughts associated with this anxiety are going to be silly and unrealistic, but I think one thing that I shouldn't do is to sit and let this feeling pass.
